# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Hurricane Simulator

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Hurricane tracker that simulates a hurricane and displays stats about it afterwards.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We plan on making a hurricane simulator. The program will simuate the path of each of the hurricanes in the starter file we recieved for the hurricane tracker lab.It will simulate their path and afterwards display statistics of the hurricane such as how much damage was caused, how many states it impacted, etc. We also plan on adding noise to the hurricane simulations if possible/if we figure that out. We also want to keep adding and improving things as we work on the project, maybe change what image is displayed for each of the different hurrincaes and things along that line. The bottom line is that we will have a simulation for all the hurricanes in the starter file and statistics about them displayed after their simulation but we plan on getting more creative and exanding upon what we already have planned as we brainstorm and think of new things to implement.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Name: Meet Patel. Email: tun80580@temple.edu TA: JoAnne Nicolas 


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
Hurricane simulator that simulates the path of many different hurricanes with some statistics showing after each one is simulated.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Hurricane simulator that simulates the path of all the hurricanes we can incude with a good amount of statistics showing for each hurricane after it is simulated. The hurricane simulations also have noise to them (if applicable).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
Hurricane simulator that simulates all the hurricanes and displays plentful data/statistics about each hurricane and at the end it displays total damage caused by all the hurricanes, which state was hit the ost, and other interesting information.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I will need to learn how to implement a click mechanism that when pressed triggers the next hurricane simulation. I was thinking something with the numbers. For example, the first simulation will run when i press "1", second one runs when i press "2", etc.
