Preproposal
Full Huricane Tracker
What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
My partner and I were planning on expanding upon the hurricane tracker lab. We plan on making simulations for each of the hurricanes in the starter file, simulate their path and afterwards display statistics of the hurricane such as how much damage was caused, how many states it impacted, etc. We also plan on adding noise to the hurricane simulations if possible/if we figure that out. We also want to keep adding and improving things as we work on the project, maybe change what image is displayed for each of the different hurrincaes and things along that line.
If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I plan to work with Shuo Li.
Do you have any questions of your own?
I do not have any questions.
